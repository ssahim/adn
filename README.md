# Advanced Network One
The objective of this course is to introduce network routing and related protocols to students. Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network, or between or across multiple networks. Routing is performed for many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), computer networks, such as the Internet, as well as in networks used in public and private transportation, such as the system of streets, roads, and highways in national infrastructure. After completion of this course you should be able to design small to med size network having different branches connected with each other.

## Topics

04. **Introduction to default route and routing algorithms**
		
	A Routing Algorithm is a method for determining the routing of packets in a node. For each node of a network, the algorithm determines a routing table, which in each destination, matches an output line. The algorithm should lead to a consistent routing, that is to say without loop. This means that you should not route a packet a node to another node that could send back the package.
